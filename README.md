Hi, my name is Sofie Schiff, and I am a sophomore here at Chatsworth High School. I am part of the Magnet Program, and I have 2 older siblings. I play volleyball here at Chatsworth, and outside of school playing club volleyball. I have been playing for 3 years and I am a setter. I don’t have a favorite book, or movie, but I do prefer watching movies over reading books.

Some personal achievements I have are almost making varsity as a sophomore, and making JV last year as a freshman. Unfortunately I am on JV this year, but almost being on varsity is a big accomplishment for me. Some goals I have for the school year is to end with straight A’s and try to pass all of my AP tests.

In the summer, I traveled to Hawaii for the first time. My family and I went to Maui. I went snorkeling, which was super cool because I saw a lot of fish and even a turtle. I also went on a 6 rope course ziplining, which was super cool even though I am afraid of heights. Another excursion that I did while in Hawaii was a helicopter ride. We went through Maui and even went to another island. While in the helicopter, the pilot also brought us to areas where Jurassic park was filmed. Going to Hawaii was also one of my most memorable moments because it was my first time in Hawaii.
